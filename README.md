# FastAPI Web Service Tutorial

Welcome to the FastAPI Web Service Tutorial repository. This project is a part of the "In 10 Minutes: Build a Web Service Using FastAPI in Python" tutorial on the Full Stack Factoids YouTube channel. In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to build a robust web service using FastAPI, a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn

## Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have the correct version of Python installed. You can verify your Python version using the following command:

```bash
python --version
```

Next, install FastAPI and Uvicorn using the following commands:

```bash
pip install fastapi
pip install uvicorn
```

If you are using Python 3 specifically, you might use `pip3` instead of `pip`.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: This is the main file where we define our FastAPI application and all the CRUD endpoints.
- `models.py`: This file contains the Pydantic models for Item, Order, and Transaction, creating a cascading relationship between the objects.

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the Uvicorn server and you can access the FastAPI application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Documentation

FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation for your application. You can access the Swagger UI at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` and ReDoc at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`.

## Testing

Test the CRUD endpoints using the interactive API documentation or using a tool like Postman.
